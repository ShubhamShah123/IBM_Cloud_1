 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
    (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

Show and submit code:

 5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name and 
    student ID in large font at the top of every web page dispayed (for this quiz)
    The cloud service provider is IBM Cloud (BlueMix).

 6. Upload all data files to cloud service, then, on a web "form" (page), allow us to enter a
    file name, and you will show it's name and size (on cloud) on your screen.
    (such as: "minnow" (or "minnow.jpg") and show the file name and size on cloud on a web page)


    @app.route('/get_single_member', methods = ['POST'])
    def get_member():
        if client:
            user = request.get_json()
            name = user['name']
            to_send_data = []
            all_user_data = map(lambda doc: doc, db)
            for x in all_user_data:
                if name == str(x['Picture']) or str(x['Picture']).startswith(name):
                    send_dict = {}
                    img_name = str(x['Picture'])
                    size = float(x["_attachments"][img_name]["length"])
                    size_data = str(float(size/1000)) + " kb."
                    send_dict = {
                        'name': img_name,
                        'size': size_data
                    }
                    to_send_data.append(send_dict)
                else:
                    pass
            return jsonify({'status': to_send_data}), 200
        else:
            return jsonify({'status': 'Not Working'}), 400



 7. Allow user to enter (select) a room number and, if possible, show the corresponding picture 
    (or show "no picture available").

    @app.route('/get_image_data', methods=['POST'])
    def get_image():
        print("---- get image data ---")
        data = request.get_json()
        room_num = data['room']
        if client:
            to_send_list = []
            all_user_data = map(lambda doc: doc, db)
            for x in all_user_data:
                if str(room_num) == str(x['Room']):
                    if x['Picture'] == "":
                        val = 'No Image Available'
                        
                    else:
                        val = 'Image Available: {0}'.format(x['Picture'])
                        
                    user_data = {
                        'image': val
                    }
                    to_send_list.append(user_data)
                else:
                    pass
            return jsonify({'status': to_send_list}), 200

 8. Allow a user to give a room range and city name and show names, city name, rooms and photos of all matching.
    (such as: rooms 400 to 500, "Arlington")

 9. Allow a user to select either a SuperPower or a single Keyword, then show names, city name, rooms and photos 
    of all matching, THEN allow a user to select any matching entry (person) and change either the SuperPower or
    the Keywords.
    (Only ONE of these is selected: "nice" (or, for example "outa"), for the selection "nice" show the two matching,
    (there are no pictures), then allow a user to modify the corresponding Keywords.) 

 10. Allow a user to give a height range and a new container (folder, directory) name, then move (don't copy) 
     the matching pictures from the original location to the new container (if in a DB, move to a new table in that
     new location). Then show a web page with the names, pictures, and rooms for each entry in both locations.
     (such as: height 160 to 170 will move 2 people (out of the 3, one doesn't have a picture) then show)
 
 11. Show GTA parts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

 12. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
     the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
